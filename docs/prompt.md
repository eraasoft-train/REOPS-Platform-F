# Build a Complete ReOps-Style Operations Management SaaS From Scratch

## ROLE

You are a senior staff-level full-stack engineer, product architect, UX/UI designer, and technical lead.

You are going to build a **completely new production-ready SaaS application from scratch**.

The product should be inspired by the functionality, information architecture, UX quality, responsiveness, and overall product experience of:

**Reference product:** https://reops.io/

IMPORTANT:

* This is a NEW repository.
* Do NOT treat this as a refactor of an existing application.
* Do NOT reuse an old dashboard architecture.
* Build the application with a clean architecture from the beginning.
* Use ReOps as a **product and UX reference**, not as source code.
* Do not copy ReOps proprietary code, assets, logos, illustrations, exact branding, or copyrighted content.
* Recreate the underlying product concepts and functionality with an original implementation and original UI.
* The result should feel like a serious commercial SaaS product, not a demo, template, or admin dashboard.

---

# 1. FIRST: STUDY THE REFERENCE PRODUCT

Before writing application code, thoroughly analyze:

https://reops.io/

Understand and reproduce the important product concepts visible on the reference site, including:

* Operations management
* Employee management
* Branch management
* Training
* Training courses
* Training plans
* SOPs / operational procedures
* Resources and documents
* Checklists
* Tasks
* Requests
* Tickets
* KPIs
* Employee performance
* Branch performance
* Reports
* Analytics
* Rewards / incentives
* User management
* Notifications
* Organization management
* Multi-branch operations
* Franchise-oriented workflows
* Arabic/English experience

The reference site describes ReOps as a unified platform for digitizing operational procedures, automating training, and monitoring performance across branches.

Do not simply copy the public landing page.

Think about what the **actual SaaS application behind the marketing website** would need.

---

# 3. TECHNOLOGY STACK

Use a modern production stack.

### Frontend

* TypeScript
* App Router
* Tailwind CSS
* shadcn/ui
* Radix UI where appropriate
* Lucide icons

Use:

* Route Handlers / Server Actions where appropriate
* Service layer
* Repository layer
* Domain layer
* Validation layer

### Database

Use:

* PostgreSQL
* Prisma ORM

Design the database properly for:

* organizations
* branches

* roles
* permissions
* courses
* lessons
* training plans
* enrollments
* SOPs
* documents
* checklists

* attachments
* KPIs
* KPI measurements
* goals
* rewards
* notifications
* audit logs

Do not create a flat database structure.

Design relationships properly.

---

# 4. ARCHITECTURE

Use a scalable architecture.

Recommended structure:

```text
src/
  app/
    (marketing)/
    (auth)/
    (dashboard)/
    api/

  components/
    ui/
    layout/
    charts/
    tables/
    forms/
    feedback/

  features/
    dashboard/
    employees/
    branches/
    training/
    courses/
    training-plans/
    sops/
    checklists/
    tasks/
    requests/
    kpis/
    performance/
    rewards/
    reports/
    notifications/
    settings/
    users/

  lib/
    auth/
    db/
    permissions/
    validation/
    utils/
    storage/

  server/
    services/
    repositories/
    actions/

  types/

  config/

  hooks/
```

Organize code by domain.

Avoid a giant `/components` folder containing the entire application.

---

# 5. MULTI-TENANT ARCHITECTURE

This must be a real SaaS.

Every organization must have isolated data.

Core concept:

```text
Organization
    ↓
Branches
    ↓
Departments / Teams
    ↓
Employees / Users
```

Every organization-owned record must be associated with an organization.

Implement proper tenant isolation.

Never rely only on frontend filtering for security.

---

# 6. AUTHENTICATION

Build complete authentication.

Support:

* Sign up
* Login
* Logout
* Forgot password
* Reset password
* Email verification
* Session management
* Protected routes

* Profile settings

Use secure authentication.

Prefer secure HTTP-only cookies for sessions.

Never store sensitive authentication tokens in localStorage.

---

# 7. AUTHORIZATION

Implement RBAC.

Example roles:

```text
Super Admin
Organization Owner
Organization Admin
Operations Manager
Branch Manager
HR Manager
Trainer
Employee
```

Create a permission system rather than hardcoding role checks everywhere.

Example permissions:

```text
employees.read
employees.create
employees.update
employees.delete

branches.read
branches.manage

training.read
training.manage

courses.create
courses.publish

sops.read
sops.manage

tasks.read
tasks.manage

requests.read
requests.manage

kpis.read
kpis.manage

reports.read
reports.export

users.manage
settings.manage
```

Permission checks must exist on the server.

---

# 8. ONBOARDING

Create a polished onboarding flow.

After registration:

### Step 1

Create organization.

### Step 2

Organization details.

### Step 3

Create first branch.

### Step 4

Choose industry.

* Retail
* Healthcare
* Hospitality
* Education
* Services
* Franchise
* Other

### Step 5

Invite employees.

### Step 6

Choose initial modules.

### Step 7

Enter application.

Make onboarding feel like a real commercial SaaS.

---

# 44. DATA IMPORT / FUTURE SCRAPING

Validator
      ↓
Normalizer
      ↓
Domain Model

# 53. IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION RULE

Do NOT build everything as fake frontend screens.

Every major module should have:

```text
UI
+
Types
+
Validation
+
Database model
+
Service
+
Repository
+
API/server action
+
Loading state
+
Error state
+
Empty state
+
Permissions
```

If a feature cannot reasonably be completed immediately, architect it correctly and clearly isolate the unfinished integration.

Do not pretend a fake button is functional.

# 54. DO NOT ASK FOR CONSTANT CONFIRMATION

You have enough requirements to make architectural decisions.

Make reasonable senior-engineering decisions yourself.

Only ask a question if continuing without the answer would create a major irreversible architectural problem.

Otherwise proceed.

# 56. MOST IMPORTANT PRODUCT PRINCIPLE

Do not build:

> "A dashboard that looks like ReOps."

Build:

> "A complete operations management SaaS that provides the same category of product experience and capabilities as ReOps, with an original implementation, scalable architecture, excellent UX, and production quality."

The final result should feel like a **real SaaS product**, not a clone, mockup, or template.

Start by creating the new repository and establishing the architecture and design system.

Then implement the product progressively until the entire application is functional.
